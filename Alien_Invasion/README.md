# How To Play:

This is a survival game. The objective is to take out as many invading aliens as you can. Use the 'X' button
to shoot a laser in the same direction you're traveling. If you run into an enemey, accidently shoot your planet,
crash into the planet, or let an invader past your defenses, you will lose a life. During the game, powerups will appear on the screen.
Golden stars give the player a speed boost. Purple stars give the player an extra life. Survive for as long as possible.
